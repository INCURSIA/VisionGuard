    "summary": " Based on the data provided from frames ['frame_60.json', 'frame_600.json', 'frame_660.json'], here's a summary of the changes in the scene:\n\n1. Cars: There are two cars labeled as car, ID 0 and ID 1. Both cars move down the road, with their positions changing in each frame. Car ID 0 appears to be moving away from Car ID 1 throughout the frames.\n2. Persons: Several people are present across the frames. One person (ID 2) in a blue shirt and brown pants is observed multiple times. Their position changes as they move along the road, but no significant interactions with other objects can be identified. Another person (ID 3) is seen doing a trick in different frames. They appear to be stationary or performing their trick on the ground.\n3. Interactions: There are no direct interactions between objects, such as cars coming close to pedestrians or people moving closer or farther from each other. The persons and cars seem to move independently of one another without any visible connections.\n4. Notable patterns: The scene features repetitive movement patterns, especially for the person in the blue shirt and brown pants (ID 2) and the individual doing a trick (ID 3). These objects appear to be present at different points along the road or street during the frames captured.\n\nIn summary, the scene consists of two cars moving down a road or street, with no significant interactions between them. There are multiple persons in the scene, some of whom perform tricks, while others simply walk along the road. The repetitive movement patterns and independent object movements suggest that this is likely an urban setting with people going about their daily activities and vehicles navigating through traffic.

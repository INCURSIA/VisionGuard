# VisionGuard
**AI-powered system for analyzing surveillance footage, detecting object movements, and summarizing security events using object detection, tracking, and visual-language models.**

---

##  Overview

VisionGuard automates the analysis of surveillance footage to detect unusual activities and provide context-aware summaries of the events. It is designed to help security officers interpret and understand the behavior of objects in real time from surveillance footage. The system uses:

YOLOv8 for object detection and Centroid Tracker for tracking moving objects across video frames.

LLaVA and BLIP to generate context-aware video summaries that describe the movement, interactions, and behavior of objects in the footage.

A security-focused feature that highlights suspicious or unusual behavior based on object movements and interactions, providing alerts and actionable insights.

Key Features:
Frame-by-frame analysis of surveillance footage with detailed object tracking and movement analysis.

Intelligent summaries that detect and describe unusual activities such as sudden changes in position, interactions between objects (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians), and other potentially suspicious patterns.

Real-time alerts for unusual events based on movement patterns and behavior inconsistencies.


-  **YOLOv8n** for real-time object detection  
-  **Centroid Tracker** to track object movements  
-  **LLaVA/BLIP** via Ollama for vision-language-based summarization  

The pipeline detects objects, tracks them across frames, and summarizes their actions in plain English.

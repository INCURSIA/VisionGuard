    "summary": " In the given data from frames ['frame_0.json', 'frame_120.json', 'frame_180.json'], there are several significant movements and interactions among the objects:\n\n1. Cars: There are two cars, one white and one brown, that appear to be driving down the road in all three frames. The white car's position changes drastically between frames 0 and 120, with a large increase in distance from the brown car. In contrast, the brown car appears to maintain a relatively constant distance from both cars.\n\n2. Pedestrians: There are four pedestrians visible across the frames. The man in a blue shirt and brown pants is seen walking on the street in frame 0 and appears to continue walking in the same direction throughout the frames. The man in a black suit doing a trick seems to be stationary, possibly performing his trick at the start of frame 0.\n\n3. Interactions: No direct interactions between the objects are evident based on their positions alone. However, the large increase in distance between the white car and the brown car from frame 0 to frame 120 suggests that the two cars might be moving away from each other or following different paths.\n\n4. Notable patterns: One notable pattern is the presence of the man in a black suit doing tricks in all three frames. This indicates that he may have stopped performing his trick after the first frame, as his position does not change significantly between frames 0 and 120.\n\nIn summary, the objects in the scene show a variety of movements and interactions. The cars seem to be moving independently of each other, while the pedestrians follow more static patterns. There are no direct interactions between the objects, but the white car's position change indicates some level of activity or movement in the scene. "
